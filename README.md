Project Proposal:  Website For Reviewing/Rating Music

System purpose:
Allow different people from around the world to rate and share music with one another. Ideally this site will help users and artists alike to share music with one another.

Actors involved:
Admins (the website creators)
Users (anyone who wishes to make an account)

Functionalities:
Users can create accounts and browse albums/songs to rate and/or leave reviews
Follow user feature
Feed of friend’s activity on the website
Albums/Songs/Artist pages that have aggregated ratings and reviews from all users


Goals:
Create a social-media platform where people can review, rate and share music with one another
Allow people to easily find new music


Chosen process: 
Our team intends to follow the Agile workflow
Size: Since our team is small (4 people), this favors an agile methodology.
Criticality: Our project is not critical, so we can afford to use an agile methodology.
Dynamism: We may change our goals and technology requirements as the project progresses, which favors an agile approach.
Personnel: Our personnel are relatively inexperienced, but willing to learn and adapt quickly. This factor does not heavily impact our chosen methodology.
Culture: Our team members don’t have a big preference for either change or predictability. This factor also does not have a significant impact on our chosen methodology.
